== Introduction ==

G02.ME functionality is available to programmers through a JSON/Javascript API.  Most of the URL's that are supported by the user-interface have a JSON-equivalent request.

All requests are of the form:

{{{
http://g02.me/...?callback=MyCallback
}}}

to which the response will look like:

{{{
MyCallback({status:"OK", ...});
}}}

Static requests can be inserted in a web page via:

{{{
<script>
function MyCallback(obj)
{
    ... your code here ...
}
</script>
<script src="http://g02.me/...?callback=MyCallback"></script>
}}}

== Concepts ==

G02.ME stored shorted URL's and collects analytics information about user interactions with those shortened URL's.  Each shortened URL is assigned an _id_ (which is encoded as a base-64 number using the digits, letters and the characters "-" and "_").

Each URL has the following information that can be retrieved about it:

  * url: The _long_ URL
  * id: The base-64 identifier for the shortened URL
  * title: The page title
  * viewed: Total number of times the G02.ME URL has been accesssed/viewed
  * shared: Total number of times users have shared this URL (mapped the full URL to it's shortcut).
  * scores: An array of time-weighted scores based on the total activity surrounding the URL. 

=== Scores ===

Each URL may have a collection of _comments_ associated with it, as well as
